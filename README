NAME
    MooseX::SemiAffordanceAccessor - Name your accessors foo() and set_foo()

SYNOPSIS
        use MooseX::SemiAffordanceAccessor;
        use Moose;

        # make some attributes

DESCRIPTION
    This module does not provide any methods. Simply loading it changes the
    default naming policy for the loading class so that accessors are
    separated into get and set methods. The get methods have the same name
    as the accessor, while set methods are prefixed with "set_".

    If you define an attribute with a leading underscore, then the set
    method will start with "_set_".

    If you explicitly set a "reader" or "writer" name when creating an
    attribute, then that attribute's naming scheme is left unchanged.

    The name "semi-affordance" comes from David Wheeler's Class::Meta
    module.
